# ConnectorCrimpHelper
Hold connectors in place on IWISS SN58B and SN28B crimpers.

Supports DUPONT and JST XH 2.54 and JS SM 2.5 connectors.

Inspired by https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4546393

The file gen_cch contains commands that generate models for both supported crimpers and all 3 types of connectors.
You need only generate those you actually want.
